# Calendar-Event-Using-PHP
This PHP application allows users to create calendar events by entering an event name, description, start date, and end date. Upon clicking "Create Event," the event is stored in a MySQL database and displayed on the webpage. Configure your database in config.php, and run the application on a web server. See index.php for the event creation form and event display logic.
